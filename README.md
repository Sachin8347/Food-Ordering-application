Which protocol is followed (TCP/UDP) {Description about that}
TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, is a crucial communication protocol within computer
networks that ensures the dependable and sequential transmission of data between devices
over an IP-based network. Operating at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite, it
collaborates with the Internet Protocol (IP) to facilitate the process.
TCP establishes a reliable and bidirectional connection between a client and a server,
guaranteeing the accurate and ordered delivery of data. It achieves this by dividing data into
smaller segments, assigning sequence numbers to maintain their order, and acknowledging
the receipt of each segment. In the event of data corruption or loss, TCP utilizes
retransmission mechanisms and error detection through checksums. Moreover, TCP
incorporates flow control and congestion control techniques to adapt to network conditions,
prevent congestion, and ensure fair resource sharing.
TCP plays a critical role in various applications, including web browsing, email, and file
transfer, where the integrity and sequence of data delivery are paramount. Its robust
mechanisms make it an essential protocol for efficient and dependable communication in
modern networks
